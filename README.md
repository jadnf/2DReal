Introduction:
This is a real time renderer and raytrace renderer that I made for my computer graphics class.

Features:
Real time rendering using blinn-phong shading. A raytracer with emissives, lambertian, and dielectric materials.

Installation: 
Download the github repository and run it in visual studio.

Usage:
Currently there is no interface to add objects to the scene, so you'd have to do that manually via editing the code itself.

Technical Details:
The realtime renderer uses blinn-phong shading for it's effects, and the raytracer uses standard techniques for it's raytracing.
